# 🧠 AI-Powered Learning Buddy

## 🌍 SDG 4: Quality Education
This project supports **SDG 4 – Quality Education** by providing an **AI-powered learning assistant** that personalizes learning recommendations for students in low-resource settings.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** for backend logic  
- **Streamlit** for web interface  
- **Pandas** for data handling  
- **(Optional)** scikit-learn for ML prediction  

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The app presents quiz questions from `questions.csv`.  
2. The student answers each question.  
3. The system evaluates performance and provides adaptive feedback.  
4. (Future versions) Use a trained ML model to predict the next best topic.  

## 🚀 Run the App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
